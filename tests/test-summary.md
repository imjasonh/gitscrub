# GitScrub Test Summary

## Test Results

### ✅ Passing Tests (9)

1. **Authentication Tests (4/4)**
   - Login page displays correctly
   - Error handling for invalid tokens
   - Continue without authentication flow
   - Logout functionality

2. **Authenticated Tests (5/5)**
   - Navigate to repository with auth
   - View file history with slider
   - Navigate commits with keyboard (← →)
   - Click on slider to jump to specific commit
   - Load more commits functionality

### ❌ Failing Tests (17)

All failing tests are due to attempting to access GitHub API without authentication:
- File history tests without auth
- Navigation tests without auth
- Public repository tests (hitting rate limits)

## Key Features Tested

### ✅ Working Features
1. **Slider Click Functionality**
   - Clicking at any position on the slider successfully jumps to the nearest commit
   - Visual feedback (active tick and thumb) updates correctly
   - Thumb position matches the active tick position

2. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Left/Right arrow keys navigate through commits
   - Slider position updates smoothly

3. **Load More Commits**
   - "Load more" button appears for repos with >100 commits
   - Loading additional commits maintains current slider position

## Test Configuration

- Tests require a GitHub Personal Access Token in `.env.test`
- Token is loaded via dotenv in playwright.config.ts
- Authenticated tests bypass rate limiting issues
- Recommended: Use a Fine-grained PAT with only "Contents: Read" permission

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test -- tests/authenticated-tests.spec.ts

# Run with UI mode
npm test:ui

# Run with specific browser
npm test -- --project=chromium
```

## Recommendations

1. All core functionality is working correctly with authentication
2. The slider click feature successfully snaps to the nearest commit
3. Consider implementing mock GitHub API responses for tests without auth
4. Add integration tests for the full user flow
