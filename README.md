# Create .env file with your GitHub OAuth App credentials
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your GITHUB_CLIENT_ID and GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET

# Start development server with Netlify Functions
netlify dev
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Create .env.test with test configuration
echo "GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_test_client_id" > .env.test

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui
```
